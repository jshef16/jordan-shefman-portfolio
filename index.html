                <h3>Front End Dev</h3>
                <p>My skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vue & Angular) make me a valuable web developer. I have studied user interface and experience in depth, learning and putting to use things like Fitts' and Steering Laws and affordances and signifiers. Through my studies, I led a team in creating an interface that we first designed with Figma, and then coded out from scratch.</p>

                <h3>Back End Dev</h3>
                <p>I first learned programming through C++. From there, it made it easy to learn other object-oriented programming languages like Java and Python. I am also very experienced in database management using SQL. My back-end programming skills provide the foundation for all of my programming accomplishments.</p>

                <h3>High Quality Tester</h3>
                <p>Testing is a skill that I have developed over my years coding. Everyone starts small, but I have learned to put together full test suites. I have been challenged by creating test suites for code bases with tens of millions of lines of code, using methods such as black-box, white-box, and mutation testing. I have experience testing on multiple levels, including unit, system, integration, and acceptance testing.</p>

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>I attended the University of Michigan and recieved a Bachelors in Computer Science. A lot of my course work was completed in C++, but I have experience in many other programming languages! I have picked up other languages from classes, summer internships, and personal projects. I think of myself as a very creative person, which is the biggest reason that I enjoy coding. To me, the best part about programming is that there is never just one answer.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I am a huge sports fan. I follow all of the Michigan teams, as well as the Detroit professional teams (that's been a struggle). I play football, basketball, and pickleball recreationally. Outside of sports, I really enjoy music, both listening and creating!</p>
